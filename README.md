# Pterodactyl-Control-Discord-Bot
Just a discord bot that gives you the ability to control your servers (as long as your server provider provides it)

---

- It would be nice if you would give me credit when using this
- This project SHOULD work with no issues. If there's one, open an issue and I will check it out.

---

**WHAT TO NOT DO?**
- host this on the same server with your bot. **I AM NOT JOKING THIS WILL BREAK A LOT OF STUFF**

---

**How to use??**
1. ok fr just fork this repo or download it to your computer
2. Add your [discord bot token](https://discord.com/developers/applications) along with your **Pterodactyl Credentials** and your **host link** to the file in **utils > config.py**
3. go to console or cmd and run pip install -U -r requirements.txt **(ENSURE YOUR DIRECTORY IS CORRECT BEFORE RUNNING IT)**
4. run python main.py
5. Sorted.

ok that's all...  *sponsor me if you'd like :)*
